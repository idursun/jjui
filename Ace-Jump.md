# Ace Jump

Ace Jump is a navigation feature inspired by tools like Emacs and IntelliJ, designed to help you quickly move to specific revisions in your repository with minimal keystrokes. In jjui, you can activate Ace Jump mode by pressing `f` (mnemonic: find), which is also familiar to users of vim-like environments.

When Ace Jump mode is enabled, change IDs and commit IDs are highlighted with shortcut keys. You can press the corresponding key to instantly jump to the desired revision. The jump is performed as soon as you enter the shortest non-ambiguous prefix, usually requiring only 1-3 keystrokes.

Ace Jump is especially useful when working with large repositories or when you need to quickly switch between different parts of your history.
