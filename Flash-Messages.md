# Flash Messages

Flash messages provide instant feedback for commands executed within jjui. When you run a command, its output is displayed as a flash message in the bottom-right corner of the Revisions view.

Behavior:
- Success messages: If the command completes successfully, the message is shown for 4 seconds and then automatically dismissed.
- Error messages: If the command fails, the error message remains visible until you dismiss it manually by pressing `esc`.

Flash messages help you quickly see the result of your actions without interrupting your workflow.
