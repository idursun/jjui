# Absorb Operation

The absorb operation lets you automatically incorporate changes from the working copy or child revisions into the selected revision. To use this feature, press `A` to run `jj absorb` on the highlighted revision.

After absorbing changes, affected revisions will display a hint line indicating they were updated by the last operation. This helps you track which commits have been modified.

Absorb is commonly used together with other revision management features such as abandon, squash, and rebase, to keep your history clean and organized.
