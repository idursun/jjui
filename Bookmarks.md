# Bookmark Menu

The bookmark menu in jjui provides an interface for managing bookmarks directly from the Revisions view. This feature allows you to organize, move, track, untrack, forget, and delete bookmarks efficiently.

To use the bookmark menu, press `b` to open the pop-up menu. The menu displays available bookmark commands for the selected revision. You can select multiple revisions using `space` before opening the menu.

Available actions include:
- Move: Press `m` to filter the list to move bookmark commands, allowing you to move bookmarks to the selected revision.
- Untrack: Press `u` to filter the list to untrack bookmark commands, letting you untrack bookmarks from the selected revision.
- Forget: Press `f` to filter the list to forget bookmark commands, which will forget bookmarks from the selected revision.
- Track: Press `t` to filter the list to track bookmark commands, enabling you to track bookmarks on the selected revision.
- Delete: Press `d` to filter the list to delete bookmark commands, removing bookmarks from the selected revision.
- Free Text Filter: Press `/` to activate the free text filter, allowing you to filter the bookmark list by typing a bookmark name.

The bookmark menu streamlines bookmark management and works alongside other revision operations such as abandon, rebase, and squash. Filtering with shortcut keys helps you quickly find the desired command for efficient workflow.
