The squash operation allows you to combine multiple revisions into a single commit, streamlining your repository history. This feature is accessible from the Revisions view and provides interactive options for advanced control.

To activate squash, press `S` in the Revisions view. The cursor will automatically move to the parent of the selected revisions, making it easy to choose the target for the squash.

Options:
- Press `e` to toggle the `--keep-emptied` argument, which keeps any emptied commits after the squash.
- Press `d` to toggle the `--use-destination-message` argument, which uses the destination commit's message for the resulting squash.
- Press `i` to toggle the `--interactive` argument, enabling interactive mode for fine-tuning the squash process.

Workflow:
1. Select the revisions you want to squash.
2. Press `S` to activate squash mode.
3. The cursor moves to the parent revision.
4. Use `e` and `i` to set your desired options.
5. Confirm to execute the squash operation.

Example:
- To squash two commits interactively and keep emptied:
  - Select the commits
  - Press `S`
  - Press `e` and `i` to enable both options
  - Confirm to squash
