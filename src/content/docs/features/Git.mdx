The Git menu in jjui provides an interface for running Git-related commands directly from the Revisions view. This feature makes it easy to perform common Git operations without leaving the application.

To use the Git menu, press `g` to open the pop-up menu. The menu displays available Git commands for the current context, allowing you to quickly access fetch, push, and other actions.

Filtering commands:
- Fetch: Press `f` to filter the list to fetch commands.
- Push: Press `p` to filter the list to push commands.

You can use assigned shortcuts to quickly invoke items in the menu. For example:
- `gpa`: Invokes `git push --all`.
- `gpc`: Invokes `git push --change`.
