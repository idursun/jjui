You can switch to op log view by pressing `o`. 

Op log view is limited to show last 200 operations by default. This can be changed by setting the `oplog.limit` configuration.

You can use the preview window (opened by pressing `p`) to display the contents of the selected operation.

Pressing `r` will restore the working directory to the state of that operation, essentially executing `jj op restore <operationid>`. You can always undo this operation by pressing `u`.

Pressing `R` will revert the selected operation, running `jj op revert <operationid>`.

Pressing `d` will show the operation changes in full diff view.
