`jjui` is a terminal user interface for working with [Jujutsu version control system](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj). I have built it according to my own needs and will keep adding new features as I need them. I am open to feature requests and contributions.

If you are new `jjui`, have a look at [previously on jjui](https://github.com/idursun/jjui/discussions/443).


<Aside>
Trunk version is at **v0.10** which is not released and contains breaking changes.
See the [migration guide](/jjui/migrating/v0_10) for what changed and how to update your configuration.
